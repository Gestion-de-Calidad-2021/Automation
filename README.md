## 2. Exploring the software that is being tested:

The software that we are testing is a website for Start Americas Together Company, this software will be used for the administration of projects and events, with the objective that volunteers that have an account in this website can see and participate in the projects/events


## 3. Pros of Automation:
- If a set of tests must be ran repeatedly, automation is a huge win
- It offers the possibility to run automation against code that frequently change to catch regressions
- Offers the possibility to add a large test matrix (e.g. different browsers on different OS platforms)
- Automated tests can be run the same time on different machines, whereas manual tests must be run sequentially
- It offers more time for the test engineer to focus on problem analysis, and verify proper performance of software following modifications and fixes
- Better Quality Software, because you can run more tests in less time with fewer resources
- Fast, automated Tools run tests significantly faster than human users.
- Reduces time to market an application/product, so we have shorter time to develop products
