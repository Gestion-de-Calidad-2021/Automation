Pros of Automation
- If a set of tests must be ran repeatedly, automation is a huge win
- It offers the possibility to run automation against code that frequently change to catch regressions
- Offers the possibility to add a large test matrix (e.g. different browsers on different OS platforms)
- Automated tests can be run the same time on different machines, whereas manual tests must be run sequentially
- It offers more time for the test engineer to focus on problem analysis, and verify proper performance of software following modifications and fixes
- Better Quality Software, because you can run more tests in less time with fewer resources
- Fast, automated Tools run tests significantly faster than human users.
- Reduces time to market an application/product, so we have shorter time to develop products
